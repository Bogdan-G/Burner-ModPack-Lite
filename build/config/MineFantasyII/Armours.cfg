    # With this option; arrows have a chance to deflect off armour. It compares the arrow damage and armour rating. Chain and plate have higher rates. Arrows bounced off can hurt enemies
    B:"Deflect Arrows"=true

    # This modifies the chance for arrows to deflect off armour: Increasing this increases the deflect chance, decreasing decreases the chance, 0 means it's impossible

"other features" {
    # (As of 2.4.2) Armour has two mechanics how it works: All armours have a value that effects how it works against cutting/blunt/piercing ratios and will react to durability loss... However the Damage Threshold system cuts a set amount of damage off, (default uses damage ratio which cuts off a percentage)
    B:"DT Armour"=false

penalties {
    # With this: Heavier armours slow your movement down acrosss both walking and sprinting. Speed is affected by design and material
    B:"Armour Slow Movement"=true

    # The minimal speed percent capable from weight (10 = 10%), MF armours don't go lower than 75% anyway
    D:"Min armour weigh speed"=10.0

    # A modifier for the rate armours slow down movement, increasing this slows you more, decreasing it slows less, just keep it above 0
