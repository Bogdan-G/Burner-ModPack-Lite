"armour list" {
    # This will register items under a certain 'Design' calculating the variables itself.
    #  Each entry has it's own line:
    # Order itemid|Design|WeightModifier 
    # The WeightModifier alters the weight for heavier or lighter materials keep it at 1.0 unless you have a special material (like mithril and adamamantium)
    # Designs can be any that are registered: MineFantasy designs are 'clothing', 'leather', 'mail', 'default'(that's just basic metal armour), and 'plate'
    # EXAMPLE (This is what vanilla gold is registered under) 
    # 314|default|2.0 
    # 315|default|2.0 
    # 316|default|2.0 
    # 317|default|2.0 
    # The 2.0 means it is 2x heavier than other vanilla armours 
    # This does not override existing MF armours

"weapon register" {
    # [Experimental] This registers weapons for the damage variable mechanics implemented by option. 
    # Though mod-added armours have absolutely no support, and never can without being specifically coded to 
    # MineFantasy armours will take these variables and function differently on the values. But weapon items can 
    # be added to the list: Put each entry on it's own line set out like this: 
    # id|cutting|blunt 
    # id is the item id (you need to find it out yourself), cutting and blunt are the ratio. 
    # The difference between the ratio is what determines damage 1|0 means 100% cutting damage, 3|1 means it's 3 cutting to 1 blunt (or 75%, 25%). use whatever numbers you need to make the ratio.
